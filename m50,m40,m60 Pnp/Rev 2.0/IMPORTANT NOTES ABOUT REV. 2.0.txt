This revision 2.0 PCB is almost identical compared to revision 1.x PCBs. But with one major difference. The Rev 2.0
supports 6cyl fully sequential. Unfortunately the 6-cyl fully seqential isn't yet supported in official Firmware.
So to be able to use the 6-cyl fully sequential, this branch needs to be used: https://github.com/pazi88/speeduino/tree/6cyl_fully_seqvential_BMW

Note that this comlicates setting to PCB for m50. For running the PCB with official firmware you need to regular BOM and jumper configuration. It's also
important to lift up the pin-7 of the IC2 away from the PCB when runnin the non-sequential mode. Leaving it connected will lead to problems. And to
run the 6-cyl fully sequential, you need to use the different BOM and jumper configuration that say "sequential" in combination with the custom FW. Note
also that you can't mix the sequential and non-sequential BOM and jumper configuration. This will lead to non-working PCB.
