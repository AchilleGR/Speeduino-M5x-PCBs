This revision 2.0 PCB is almost identical compared to revision 1.x PCBs. But with one major difference. The Rev 2.0
supports 6cyl fully sequential. Unfortunately the 6-cyl fully seqential isn't yet supported in official Firmware.
So to be able to use the 6-cyl fully sequential, this branch needs to be used: https://github.com/pazi88/speeduino/tree/6cyl_fully_seqvential_BMW

Note that this comlicates setting to PCB for m52. For running the PCB with official firmware you need to regular BOM and solder all the -solder jumpers on the PCB.
run the 6-cyl fully sequential, you need to use the different BOM that says "sequential" and NOT CONNECT the solder jumpers, in combination with the custom FW.
