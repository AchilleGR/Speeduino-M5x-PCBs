# Revision 3.0B

This rev 3.0B board is not recommended to be fully assembled by hand. For that use older THT revisions. The BOM is JLC-PCB assembly optimized and 
if you are getting your own boards done, it's highly recommended to get the SMT assembly done for components that are available. For JLC-PCB SMT assembly, 
use the "EasyEda export" BOM. The "Not JLC assembled" -BOM is to buy the rest of the components for hand soldering that aren't available for JLC-PCB SMT assembly.

NOTE! The parts stock for JLC-PCB SMT assembly changes constantly. Go through the selected components really carefully if you are getting boards made by yourself to avoid problems.
