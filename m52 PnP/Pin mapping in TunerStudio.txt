As Board Layout choose "Speeduino v0.4" and most of the pins will be "board default"

But in addition to that:

- Baro sensor: A5
- CEL light on instrument cluster: D37
- Spare relay output on external connector: D35
- Two remaining relay outputs at ULN are unconnected, but inputs are wired to D33 and D31
